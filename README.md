# Introduction

A soundtrack for a cinematic movie or a commercial or a game has 3 elements (DME):
- Dialogue - is shorthand for any spoken word like an announcer track
- Music - is anything from a symphony orchestra to a drone from a didgeridoo 
- Effects - is anything from breathing to giant explosions

Plugins are software enhancements to the application that let you perform specialized processing

When you change the output Pro Tools has to quit your session make the change and then reopen your session

**Hardware Buffer Size**
The simple choice here is you want to use the one that's the fastest without compromising your sound
If I go to 32 in the regime that I've set up here with running the app, running the operating system, recording audio and making movies at the same time I'm probably going to get a glitch. 
I'm content with 256. Most of the time that's going to be fine. 
Notch up if your system can handle it. Smaller is better. But not if it causes you a glitch.

Ignore Errors during Playback/Record - DISABLE
Video Engine - DISABLE

## Signal Flow in Pro Tools

Setup > Hardware
Setup > I/O

**SHORTCUT: Command + Left/Right Arrow to move between tabs**

Inputs:
Examples are microphones, musical instruments like guitars and basses, keyboards, turntables, things that would send audio signals into Pro Tools

Outputs:
Examples are speakers which in the world of audio production we call monitors and headphones.
We can also output digitally to other devices, that's what S/PDIF is all about

Buses:
When you want to send multiple signals to the same place you put them on a bus 

Inserts:
Are things that come between the input and the output.
Examples are reverbs, delays, compressors, other types of digital sound processing gear and sometimes we put the insert on a track and sometimes we put it on a bus.

Preamps:
This would be a digital patch bay where you could set up your Pro Tools routing.

**ADVICE: When you find settings that are working for you, export them. This will export them to the correct place**
If you import settings from that file it will only import the active tab, you can apply it to all tabs using "Apply to all tabs"

## Digital Audio 101
ProTools process audio digitally as zeros and ones.
Our ears can hear from about 20 cycles on the low end to about 22000 cycles on the high end.
In the world of music you're going to use 44.1kHz
In the world of video you're going to use 48kHz

Bit Depth:
Let us perceive dynamic range, the louds and the softs
Most people these days are comfortable at 24
Legacy sessions are more likely to be 16
So a 24 bit resolution is 50 percent higher quality than a 16 and that gives you a more accurate dynamic range

File Type:
BWF - Broadcast Wave File

# Elastic Audio

## Elastic Audio for a Voice Track

These are the algorithms available for elastic audio
These 3 doesn't affect the pitch:
- Polyphonic - when you have more than one tone at the same time (chords)
- Rhythmic - when you don't have any pitches
- Monophonic - just one voice
These one will not only change the timing but also the speed 
- Varispeed

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 29 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131259644-fc3aa7d6-a995-46d1-9a09-76caea3c501f.png)

If you select Monophonic and change from Waveform to Analysis, you should see something like this:

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 34 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131259841-f322535d-48c2-41e1-91ed-e8e8eaa23a50.png)

There are more markers than we want, so we can adjust markers and Option + Click to remove a marker

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 39 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131259993-0ea3ec54-c0b5-460b-b21d-c42cc7985163.png)

That's the Analysis, now we can move to Warp

Double-Click to add an Anchor Point

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 41 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260057-4d96d036-9007-43fe-9818-c9a0b557d026.png)

And now you can stretch:

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 42 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260079-5cddaa9c-2331-4746-8a42-494f169174b3.png)

We notice the Monophonic sounds robotic, so we can to Polyphonic and it sounds better

You'll know if Elastic Audio was applied to a Clip because of that icon:

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 45 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260223-0a0a8834-41fd-4e2f-8d32-4ec88eea2801.png)

## Elastic Audio for Music

We want to keep the Kick Parts and move the Snare Parts

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 52 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260381-fc942c9b-1beb-4609-9945-c794cc85216d.png)

In this case we will use Rhythmic algorithm

Track > Create Click Track

You can Enable/Disable the Click with that icon in Transport Window

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 54 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260450-9910f287-8e32-4e37-9fad-4333983b35dc.png)

Now we switch to Analysis

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 56 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260504-272aeb1d-d991-426b-afe4-c71001cf8a90.png)

We move to Warp and start Anchoring the good parts

It's easier if we move to Grid Mode and we are sure that the grid is a 1/4 note

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 12 59 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131260615-070d9b6d-2421-48b6-aacc-b6e5ffceb425.png)

## Arranging using the Timeline

Let's say we want an intro, so let's move the drums and guitar to Bar 5:

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 13 49 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131262016-857da265-3da6-4d7c-b98f-004c3e8e8146.png)

Use the Loop Trimmer, that shows automatically if you have a loop in the timeline

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 13 52 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131262089-5f72e228-6a07-49e2-8540-13e9c2872455.png)

Options > Quick Punch

Now you can use F12 to stop recording

This will for example give a new bar 9 but keep original bar 10

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 14 31 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131263082-009ab6f1-a9c9-4d8a-93db-dc41f5d6327f.png)

Or record some part, keep the original part and recording a new part after

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 14 33 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131263126-d90aff9e-8b1c-44cc-be30-aa8b1ce9e2b5.png)

## The Philosophy of Mixing

Create a Session with "24+EQ+Dyn+FX Returns" Template (Record+Mix Category)

The beauty of mix is in how the sounds blend and compliment one another and not how a single instrument sound by itself

## EQ and Volume

**Volume - OPTION 1**

Anytime you have more than 1 Track happenning at the same time you want a Master Fader

The idea is to move individual faders so that you can leave the Master Fader at 0, and have the peak from -3 to 0.3

RECOMMENDATION: Line the tracks up in their orden of importance  

If your tracks were recorded right your faders are going to be loud, a little softer, a little softer ...

**EQ - OPTION 2**

Another option is to carve out a space in the frequency spectrum that lets that part stand out

Let's say you want the guitar to have more presence in the middle frequencies; rather than boost the middle frequencies of the guitar try reducing those same frequencies in the bass

If two sounds are fighting one another, try EQ

You can boost the good stuff or cut the bad stuff

![Screen Shot 2021-08-29 at 19 07 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/131269875-bfc7ae6a-8b93-4e87-90b7-4e47ddcf403b.png)

Thinking about the texture of each element:
- Does it need Reverb?
- Does it need Delay?
- Does it need Compression?
- Is the Volume perfect from End to End?

## Busses, Sends, Auxes and Inserts

These are some effects that are common for a Pop Song:

If it's red it means the Send Level has been exceeded , there's been digital clipping

Transport Windows > Fade-in (it saves you from having an instant full volume when you hit play)

## Panning, Marker Locations and the Universe

**Panning**

It's important to equilibrate the panning and not just have it at 100 left and right in Stereo, and at the center if it's Mono

## Automating Volume, Pan and Send Levels

### VOLUME Automation

#### Auto Write

1.- Go from "auto read" to "auto write"

![Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 23 40 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134793934-1c2dcc4a-c2a1-4099-8bc6-46fe76f1e923.png)

2.- Hit space bar to start playing

3.- Make a volume move

4.- The button changes to "auto latch" 

(if it's not switching to latch):
Setup > Preferences > Mixing > Automation > After Write Pass, Switch To: Latch

![Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 23 44 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134793982-3505c838-666d-4952-8841-cafe1a50a29a.png)

latch - in case you want the fader where you left it

touch - in case you want the fader where it was originally

There's the volume move:

Automating the Panning will erase the automation of the Volume
So if you want to automate particular items we can enable and disable those

Jump to the Mix Window

If you want to record automation during the recording process:

Setup > Preferences > Operation > Record > Enable Automation in Record

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 06 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797482-83c0c9b2-dbb8-4a9f-ab02-7e3af21191b2.png)

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 14 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797713-67deae1a-f563-4c19-91d1-ef492d682633.png)

Click in th auto icon:

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 14 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797729-ea76f717-5b9c-43c0-89fd-0812b3a7ae75.png)

They are in the left:

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 15 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797748-1aa18bdb-2088-41e2-8fb6-61f42cd66f2c.png)

Select the ones you want to automate, and move them to the right:

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 16 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797783-4d073719-5107-4b97-ae7d-0c89b9cbc34d.png)

After that they'll be colored green:

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 16 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797798-cf34957d-7d70-4f5b-bd4a-3ef96ef7c1a3.png)

If you change to "auto write", they'll be colored red:

![Screen Shot 2021-09-26 at 2 18 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51218415/134797866-c65aecd0-9a42-4206-9a19-2afff8ea996e.png)

Be careful if you change the type of reverb in the middle of mix or even in tracking

You'll likely hear a click as it changes the algorithm

These are automatable, but you might want to just change it in a muted spot 

For example if you automate a change in the Decay of the Reverb

You can see the automation in LongVerb > Decay
